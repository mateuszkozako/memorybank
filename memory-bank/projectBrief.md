# Project Brief

## Project Overview
Multi-phase engineering project covering Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline optimization and Terraform infrastructure alignment for Azure Data Factory resources. The project focused on improving build performance, implementing comprehensive caching strategies, and achieving Infrastructure as Code (IaC) coverage with zero-drift management.

## Core Objectives
### Phase 1: Pipeline Optimization (Completed September 24, 2025)
- [x] Analyze and fix gradle task consistency issues in pipeline tests stage
- [x] Implement comprehensive gradlew and Docker caching solutions
- [x] Optimize artifact reuse between pipeline stages to eliminate duplicate builds
- [x] Upgrade pipeline templates to use latest caching capabilities

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Alignment (Completed September 25, 2025)
- [x] Align Terraform configuration with existing Azure Data Factory infrastructure
- [x] Eliminate configuration drift between Terraform and deployed resources
- [x] Import newly created data flow into Terraform state management
- [x] Achieve zero-drift Infrastructure as Code coverage

## Scope
### In Scope
**Pipeline Optimization:**
- Azure DevOps pipeline optimization for NFOS Mashgin Fueling Service
- Main branch pipeline (`azure-pipelines-main.yml`) and feature branch pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`)
- Gradle build optimization and caching implementation
- Docker image caching and reuse strategies
- Pipeline template upgrades and parameter optimization

**Infrastructure Management:**
- Store Locator Azure Data Factory infrastructure (`stoloc-infrastructure/terraform/us/adf/`)
- UAT and Production environment Terraform configurations
- Data flow import and management ("own_prices_data_flow")
- Configuration drift resolution and alignment
- Infrastructure as Code implementation

### Out of Scope
- Application code changes
- New infrastructure provisioning
- Deployment environment configurations beyond existing resources
- New feature development
- Infrastructure modifications that would disrupt existing services

## Target Audience
- DevOps engineers maintaining NFOS pipelines and Store Locator infrastructure
- Development teams using the Mashgin Fueling Service
- Infrastructure teams managing Azure Data Factory resources
- CI/CD pipeline users requiring faster build times
- Teams implementing Infrastructure as Code practices

## Success Criteria
### Pipeline Optimization
- [x] Eliminated gradle task inconsistencies and build errors
- [x] Implemented comprehensive caching (Gradle, Java, Docker)
- [x] Achieved optimal artifact reuse (build once, use everywhere)
- [x] Significantly improved pipeline performance and reliability
- [x] Both pipelines use identical, optimized configurations

### Infrastructure Alignment
- [x] Achieved zero-drift between Terraform configuration and Azure resources
- [x] Successfully imported complex data flow resource into Terraform state
- [x] All UAT resources (9 total) now managed by Terraform
- [x] Production configuration updated for consistency
- [x] Infrastructure changes now version-controlled and reviewable

## Key Constraints
- **Technical:** Must maintain compatibility with existing ndevops-infrastructure templates and deployed Azure resources
- **Time:** Changes needed to be backward compatible and non-disruptive
- **Resources:** Limited to existing Azure DevOps infrastructure and Azure subscriptions
- **Safety:** No modifications to running production workloads during alignment

## Core Requirements
### Functional Requirements
**Pipeline:**
- Pipeline must build and test Java 24 application successfully
- Docker images must be built and published to container registry
- Artifacts must be properly cached and reused between stages
- Both main and feature branch pipelines must work consistently

**Infrastructure:**
- Terraform configuration must match existing Azure resources exactly
- Data flows and pipelines must continue operating without disruption
- All resources must be manageable through Infrastructure as Code
- Environment-specific configurations must be preserved

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Minimize build times through comprehensive caching
- **Reliability:** Eliminate build errors, inconsistencies, and configuration drift
- **Maintainability:** Use standardized templates and Infrastructure as Code
- **Efficiency:** Avoid duplicate builds, downloads, and manual infrastructure changes
- **Safety:** Zero-disruption alignment with existing infrastructure

## Deliverables
### Pipeline Optimization
- [x] Optimized main branch pipeline (`azure-pipelines-main.yml`)
- [x] Optimized feature branch pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`)
- [x] Comprehensive caching implementation (Gradle, Java 24, Docker)
- [x] Artifact reuse strategy between test and build stages
- [x] Documentation of optimizations and performance improvements

### Infrastructure Alignment
- [x] Aligned UAT Terraform configuration (`stoloc-infrastructure/terraform/us/adf/uat/`)
- [x] Updated Production Terraform configuration (`stoloc-infrastructure/terraform/us/adf/prd/`)
- [x] Imported data flow resource with proper lifecycle management
- [x] Zero-drift verification and validation
- [x] Infrastructure as Code best practices documentation

## Technical Achievements

### Pipeline Engineering
- **Template Mastery:** Successfully upgraded and configured v24 templates
- **Multi-layer Caching:** Implemented Gradle, Java, Docker, and artifact caching
- **Parameter Expertise:** Proper separation of JVM and Gradle options
- **Performance Engineering:** Achieved optimal build-once-use-everywhere pattern

### Infrastructure Engineering
- **Terraform Import Expertise:** Successfully imported complex Azure Data Factory resources
- **Configuration Alignment:** Mastered drift resolution through iterative plan-adjust cycles
- **Azure Data Factory Patterns:** Learned complex data flow configuration requirements
- **Multi-Environment Management:** Balanced consistency with environment-specific needs

### Resource Management
**UAT Environment (All 9 Resources Managed by Terraform):**
1. Resource Group, 2. Data Factory, 3. SQL Server, 4. SQL Database, 5. Storage Account
6. Data Flow (newly imported), 7. Pipeline, 8. Key Vault Linked Service, 9. SQL Database Linked Service

**Production Environment:**
- Configuration updated for consistency while preserving environment-specific differences
- Ready for similar import processes when needed

## Project Impact
- **Pipeline Performance:** Significant build time improvements through comprehensive caching
- **Infrastructure Management:** Full Infrastructure as Code coverage with zero-drift
- **Operational Excellence:** Version-controlled infrastructure changes and automated validation
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Documented patterns and best practices for future projects
- **Risk Reduction:** Eliminated manual infrastructure management and configuration drift
