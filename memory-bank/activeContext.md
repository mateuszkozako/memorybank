# Active Context

## Current Session Overview
**Date**: September 24, 2025
**Focus**:
- Cline conversation history discovery and export tooling
- OCM client Lambda list-clients enablement follow-up

## Workstream Highlights

### Cline Conversation History (September 24, 2025)
- Implemented `scripts/export_cline_history.py` to bundle each task directory into sanitized JSON archives; redacts message text by default with optional `--include-content` flag.
- Verified exporter against `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev`, producing redacted outputs in `./cline_history_export_test/`.
- Generated concise summaries for all task archives (CLH-5) including API/UI turn counts, context trimming traces, time spans (UTC), and aggregate storage footprint.

### OCM Client Updates (September 24, 2025)
- Lambda handler supports `operation="list_clients"`, with lazy Azure credential caching and expanded unit coverage (`test_handler_operation_list_clients`).
- Terraform redeploy (dev) refreshed image digest to `sha256:2b5433e3a149d9156be840f34faad753eb31d1f1883fb0d0f4a4c5b0e0103fe7`; validation invoke returned 10 active clients.
- Monitoring window underway before promoting to production; coordinating cleanup of legacy dev clients once stakeholders approve.

## Completed This Session âœ…
- CLH-1 .. CLH-5 delivered (inventory, analysis, reporting, export script, per-task summaries).
- Documented conversation storage locations and provided sanitized export artifacts.

## In Progress ðŸ”„
- Continue OCM client monitoring for 4xx noise prior to production rollout.
- Plan for legacy dev OAuth client cleanup post-monitoring.

## Next Actions
1. Track CloudWatch metrics for `ocm-client-test`; schedule production redeploy pending clean telemetry.
2. Decide on retention policy/location for generated Cline transcript archives.
3. Coordinate removal of stale dev clients once stakeholders confirm.
