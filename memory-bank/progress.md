# Progress

## What Works
### Java 25 Pipeline Upgrade (Latest Completion)

**Main Branch Pipeline (`azure-pipelines-main.yml`):**
- ✅ **UPGRADED TO JAVA 25:** `containerImage: 'eclipse-temurin:25'`, `jdkVersionOption: '1.25'`, `javaVersion: '25.0.0+11'`
- ✅ Uses `tests-java-v24.yaml` template with comprehensive caching (Java 25 compatible)
- ✅ Gradle task consistency: `gradleTasks: 'clean build'`
- ✅ Proper JVM options: `gradleOptions: '-Xmx4096m'`
- ✅ Docker cache restoration: `restoreDockerCache: true`
- ✅ Artifact reuse: downloads build artifacts from test stage
- ✅ Multi-environment deployment: Dev, QA, UAT in parallel
- ✅ Trigger configuration: main branch only (`include: - main`)

### Pipeline Optimizations Foundation (Completed September 24, 2025)

**Caching Implementation:**
- ✅ Gradle cache with source version-based keys
- ✅ Java 24 installation cache to avoid repeated downloads
- ✅ Docker image cache for CosmosDB, testcontainers, mock images
- ✅ Build artifact cache for reuse between stages
- ✅ Proper cache key strategies for optimal hit rates

**Performance Optimizations:**
- ✅ Build-once-use-everywhere artifact strategy
- ✅ Parallel Gradle execution with daemon mode
- ✅ Comprehensive Docker image caching and restoration
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate builds between test and build stages

### Terraform Infrastructure Alignment (Completed September 25, 2025)

**Store Locator ADF Infrastructure (`stoloc-infrastructure/terraform/us/adf/`):**
- ✅ UAT environment: Complete configuration alignment with existing Azure infrastructure
- ✅ Production environment: Added missing managed identity configuration
- ✅ Zero-drift achievement: UAT terraform plan shows "No changes"
- ✅ All 9 UAT resources now managed by Terraform
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code fully implemented

**UAT Configuration Alignment:**
- ✅ SQL Database: SKU aligned to "S3" to match deployed resource
- ✅ SQL Server: Added `express_vulnerability_assessment_enabled = true`
- ✅ Storage Account: Aligned public access, retention policies, versioning settings
- ✅ Data Factory: Corrected Application and Compute tags
- ✅ Resource Group: Tag consistency achieved
- ✅ All linked services and pipelines: Configuration verified

**Data Flow Import and Management:**
- ✅ Discovered "own_prices_data_flow" using Azure CLI
- ✅ Added Terraform resource configuration with proper structure
- ✅ Successfully imported existing data flow into Terraform state
- ✅ Configured lifecycle management to ignore dynamic script changes
- ✅ Verified zero-drift post-import with terraform plan

**Production Configuration Updates:**
- ✅ Added missing `use_managed_identity = true` to SQL linked service
- ✅ Maintained environment-specific configurations (SKUs, replication, security)
- ✅ Ensured consistency patterns across UAT and Production

- ✅ Aligned storage account settings with deployed configuration
- ✅ Corrected SQL server vulnerability assessment settings
- ✅ Successfully imported complex data flow resource

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Pipeline Optimization Journey (September 24, 2025)
**Initial State:** Main pipeline used `tests-java-v8.yaml` with basic caching, inconsistent gradle tasks
**Optimization Process:** Template upgrade, parameter correction, cache optimization, validation
**Final State:** Both pipelines use `tests-java-v24.yaml` with comprehensive caching and consistency

### Infrastructure Alignment Journey (September 25, 2025)
**Initial State:** Terraform configuration had drift with existing Azure infrastructure
**Analysis Phase:** Used `terraform plan` to identify specific configuration mismatches
**Alignment Process:** Iteratively updated Terraform configuration to match existing resources
**Import Phase:** Discovered and imported newly created data flow using Azure CLI
**Final State:** Zero-drift infrastructure with all resources managed by Terraform

## Key Metrics and Outcomes
