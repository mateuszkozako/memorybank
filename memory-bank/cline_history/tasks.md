# Task Breakdown – Cline Conversation History Discovery

| ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Effort | Files / Areas |
|----|-------------|---------------------|--------|---------------|
| CLH-1 | Inventory directory contents recursively to map file types and sizes. | Summary table of files with key metadata (path, size, type); no sensitive contents exposed. | S | `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/` |
| CLH-2 | Inspect candidate files for conversation history (JSON, DB, logs) and summarize findings. | Identify files that plausibly store conversation/session data; provide non-sensitive summaries or confirm absence. | M | `state/`, `tasks/`, `cache/`, `checkpoints/` |
| CLH-3 | Consolidate analysis into report referencing detected structures and next steps. | Final response outlines which files contain history (or not), recommended handling, and confidence level. | S | Memory bank docs & final chat response |
| CLH-4 | Create a script to export or redact `api_conversation_history.json` files into a safer archive format. | Script exists, runs read-only by default, outputs sanitized archive per task; usage documented. | M | `tasks/*/api_conversation_history.json`, helper script location TBD |
| CLH-5 | Generate concise summaries for each task folder’s conversation/session metadata. | Produce short per-task summaries covering timeframe, file counts, notable attributes; no sensitive text leaked. | S | `tasks/*`, final report |
