# Problem / Task Intake (PT)

## Request Summary
- Analyze the directory `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/` (associated with the Cline extension for Cursor).
- Identify whether any files store conversation history or related artifacts.

## Known Inputs
- macOS workspace at `/Users/ok701f` with Cursor editor installed.
- Target directory currently contains subfolders: `cache`, `checkpoints`, `puppeteer`, `settings`, `state`, `tasks` (as of September 24, 2025).

## Desired Outcomes
- Determine if conversation history exists within this directory structure.
- Document file names and likely storage formats for any discovered history data.
- Highlight absence of history files if none are present.

## Constraints & Considerations
- Maintain read-only inspection; no modifications to user data.
- Respect security guidance in `copilot-rules.md` (avoid exposing sensitive contentsâ€”summaries only).

## Open Questions / Clarifications
- Should binary or large JSON files be summarized at a high level rather than dumped entirely?
- Are there specific conversation dates or agents the user is interested in, or is the request broad?
