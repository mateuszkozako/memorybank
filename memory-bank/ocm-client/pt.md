# Product Thinking - ocm-client

## Problem Statement
Development teams need secure, automated OAuth client management that integrates with PingFederate for authentication, but manual client provisioning is error-prone, time-consuming, and doesn't scale across multiple environments.

## User Story
As a development team, I need to automatically provision and manage OAuth clients for my applications across dev/staging/prod environments, so that I can focus on application development instead of authentication infrastructure setup.

## Success Metrics
- Client provisioning time: < 5 minutes (down from hours)
- Zero manual OAuth configuration steps
- 100% environment parity for authentication
- Automated credential rotation and lifecycle management

## Scope & Constraints
**In Scope:**
- Lambda-based OAuth client management
- PingFederate API integration
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Multi-environment support
- Secure credential storage

**Constraints:**
- PingFederate API limitations
- AWS Lambda execution limits
- Security compliance requirements

## Dependencies
- PingFederate API
- AWS Lambda runtime
- AWS Secrets Manager
- DynamoDB for state management
- GitLab CI/CD pipeline
